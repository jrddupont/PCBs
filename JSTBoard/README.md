This board connects up to 30 JST ZR (1.5mm pitch) or PH (2.0mm pitch) connectors in parallel in 6 groups of 5, the board can be snapped apart into smaller boards if desired.   
The standard use case is to connect four solar panels in parallel to a single output connector.    

JST ZR (1.5mm): https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/jst-sales-america-inc/B2B-ZR/926564  
JST PH (2.0mm): https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/jst-sales-america-inc/B2B-PH-K-S/926611    
  
I have included an STL for a 3D printed jig to help solder the 1.5mm JST connectors to the board.
